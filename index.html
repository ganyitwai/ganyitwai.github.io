    <span class="zi">Malaysia background:</span><br>
    Malaysia has a tropical rainforest climate and is located near the equator, so it is hot throughout the year. It is surrounded mostly by sea and contains many islands, some of which are Betruit Island, Langkawi, and Penang Island. Half of Malaysia is covered in trees, hence the climate. Some of these forests have become preserved and turned into parks for visitors. 
    <br><br>
    <span class="zi">China background:</span><br>
    China has tropical monsoon climate zone, subtropical monsoon climate zone, temperate monsoon climate zone.
    Chinese culture has a long history, extensive and profound, and is colorful. As the cultural supremative country of the East Asian cultural circle, Chinese culture occupies an important position in the world cultural system. Due to the differences in geographical location and natural conditions, Chinese culture and economy also have their own characteristics.

This can be the residence of the emperor Puyi of the Qing Dynasty, which has shaped a lot of the historical background of the Qing Dynasty and clearly presented the living environment of the emperor in ancient times. There is also a brief introduction about the emperor in the courtyard and the emperor's preferences are also written on it. Here attracted many foreign friends and spread the Chinese history of the extensive and profound. If you want to come here, please take the No. 102 bus to the puppet palace stop and you can also bring some food and water for lunch.
<br><br><br><br>
<span class="zi">(净月潭国家森林公园)：Jingyuetan Home Forest Park：</span><br>
It is one of the 5A scenic spots in China. It is a big place with many recreational buildings and many recreational activities such as golf, horse racing and skating in winter. The most enjoyable thing is that people will choose to have a picnic here in spring or summer. This is a good chance for lovers and friends or family who haven't seen each other for a long time. You can take the 420 bus to here and buy the ticket to enter the park directly. If you get tired of walking in the park, you can take the tour bus, which I think is a good choice
<br><br><br><br>
<span class="zi">(长影世纪城)：Changchun Movie Wonderland：</span><br>
It's kind of a favorite place for kids to go to on Children's Day or on all kinds of holidays and the school or the parent-teacher association organizes students to come here. The film theme park here is mainly based on the movie theme park, referred to as East Hollywood is the essence of the United States Hollywood Universal Studios and Disney Amusement Park from the building. There's a lot of entertainment like the volcanic eruptions and the people that are involved in recreating the scene to create a scary atmosphere and it's very experiential. But I think the food and water here are very expensive and unpalatable, so if you want to come, you can bring some snacks or water. You can take No.120 to get off at Liuying Road, because it is a good choice for children

It is recognised as a world heritage site, where massive caves are the center of focus when visiting. It houses thick rain forests, which makes traversing the terrain difficult. Here, the cave systems has the largest passage and is also the largest underground chamber in the world. One particular cave of interest is the Deer Cave which is 122 meters high. If you're visiting here, you can try climbing the Sarawak Chamber and Paku Waterfall. Another challenge would be the Pinnacles Summit Trek, which requires proper preparation.
 <br><br><br><br>
<span class="zi">Kek Lok Si Temple, George Town：</span><br>
It is Malaysia's largest Buddhist temple which is located on a hill, at the bottom of Air Itam. This temple saw construction in 1890, where many buddha statues makes this place worthy of visit.
